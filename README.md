##Environment Setup
1. File -> Sync Project With Gradle Files
2. Build -> Make Project
3. You need a device (virtual or hardware) to run anything in this project
4. Tools -> AVD Manager ->create virutal device.
5. Choose any image (James Webb is using a Pixel 2 API 25)
6. If on AMD you MUST pick a system image with an ABI or either armeabi-v7a, or arm64-v8a under the Other Images tab
7. Donâ€™t worry about the Your CPU does not support required features.  Your emulator will run slower than it would with intel but it will still run

##Running Unit tests
1. Build Project
2. In file explorer (left hand side of IDE) Android/app/java
3. Right click and select run to run a file (MainActivity, or MainActivityTest) (this will not work if you don't have an emulator setup - See Environment Setup)
4. If running a unit test file still does not cause your test to run you can try: File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart
